// fenceBumpExpr is the single SET fragment that advances a row's ownership
// fence. claim_fence is a monotonic counter bumped ONLY on ownership
// transitions — claim, unclaim/release, lease reclaim, assignee change,
// reopen (closed→open), transfer — never by content mutations (notes,
// metadata, close). Guarded verbs compare it with IfFence so an actor holding
// a stale read of the ownership state gets a typed conflict instead of
// silently stomping newer ownership; see migration 0055 and
// engdocs/plans/ownership-fencing/DESIGN.md (gascity).
//
// INVARIANT: every SQL statement that bumps claim_fence MUST also rewrite
// row_lock in the same statement. A monotonic cell is exactly the write
// pattern Dolt cell-merges silently (two concurrent N→N+1 bumps write
// identical values, no conflict); the random row_lock rewrite is what forces
// racing ownership transitions to serialize. The fragment itself carries no
// row_lock — statements that compose it own the pairing (claim pairs via the
// lease clause, updateIssueInTx via its unconditional row_lock append, the
// proxied Update via an explicit "row_lock = ?"). Literal-form bumps are
// checked by TestFenceBumpAlwaysPairsRowLock; fragment-composed statements
// are covered by the behavioral fence tests in internal/storage/dolt.

// FenceBumpExpr exposes the bump fragment to sibling storage layers that
// hand-roll their ownership SQL (the proxied-server domain/db repository),
// so the fence discipline cannot drift between dispatch layers.

// upsertAssigneeChanged is the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE predicate for "this
// upsert changes the row's owner". Both sides are COALESCEd to ” because the
// system has two representations of unassigned — unclaim writes ”, while
// reclaim and NullString-bound inserts write NULL — and the claim WHERE
// clauses already treat them as equivalent. Without the normalization, a
// content-only re-import of a previously-unclaimed row (” stored, NULL
// incoming) would spuriously bump the fence and conflict legitimate
// outstanding guards.

// assignments (plus their bound args) that apply the fence discipline to
// import/upsert paths: an upsert that changes the stored assignee is an
// ownership transition, so it bumps claim_fence and rewrites row_lock in the
// same statement. Callers MUST place the fragment FIRST in the assignment
// list — ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE evaluates assignments in order and column
// references see pre-assignment values only until the column is reassigned,
// so the assignee/updated_at comparisons must run before those columns are
// rewritten. The row_lock value is bound as a parameter so all row_lock
// entropy stays on the single freshRowLock (crypto/rand) path.
//
// With rejectStaleUpdate, the bump mirrors the stale guard on the column
// assignments: the assignee only actually changes when the incoming row is
// strictly newer, so the fence only moves then too.

// invalidate legitimate orchestrator ownership snapshots for no protective
