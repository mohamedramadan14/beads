// UnclaimIssueInTx atomically releases a claimed issue: it clears the assignee,
// resets status to "open", clears the lease columns (lease_expires_at,
// heartbeat_at, started_at) and rewrites row_lock so a concurrent heartbeat or
// reclaim on the same row conflicts rather than silently cell-merging (see the
// row_lock invariant in lease.go). Records an "unclaimed" event.
//
// Ownership: only the current assignee may release its own claim. A mismatched
// actor is rejected with storage.ErrNotOwner rather than a silent no-op, so a
// second agent cannot yank a claim it does not hold. Pass force=true to bypass
// the ownership check (admin/reaper use, threaded from `bd unclaim --force`).
//
// Only works on issues that have an assignee and status is "open" or
// "in_progress". Returns error if:
//   - Issue is closed (cannot unclaim closed issues)
//   - Issue has no assignee (nothing to unclaim)
//   - Issue is claimed by a different actor and force is false (ErrNotOwner)
